                            <p>Suddenly, my logic throws up this error if I try to record a drum track. After anywhere from a minute to 3 of recording, it will stop and throw up a "Disk is too slow or system overload" error. It didn't do this for tracking guitar or bass a week ago, does anybody know what is causing.

It’s also worth noting that your Mac doesn’t have an unlimited amount of physical memory. If the system ever requires more memory than is physically available, it’ll resort to using your hard disk as virtual memory. In one of my projects, every time it gets to bar 9 it always gives me the "Disk is too slow or System Overload" warning. I have 24gb of RAM, 6 core 3.33ghz processor, running my project from an external hard drive, and I have frozen all of my tracks except 
Monitoring SQL Server performance is a complex task, as performance depends on many parameters, both hardware and software. It’s recommended to monitor these parameters proactively in order to prevent any potential performance degradation. I keep getting that error message when hitting playback on large projects with lots of tracks (which I lock). I have a 2013 Macbook Hi I often use the sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats DMV to calculate Avg Service Time for a file and also for a drive (by aggregation). Recently, i have compared DMV latency results (ReadLatency and WriteLatency for each drive) and perfmon counters (Avg. Disk sec/Read and Avg. Disk sec/Write). I'm having lots of trouble recording live bands with Logic pro 8 I'm recording with an Presonus Firestudio project and a Presonus Firepod So my old mac has started having issues running Logic. It says the "Disk is too slow or system overload." I presume I need to upgrade my RAM or processor? I feel like I've tried everything but nothing is helping. I also probably have to buy a hard drive and move everything on to there. I know I should've done this before but now I'm paying the price. Can anyone help me, also what is a good cheap hard drive for music production, do I need a SSD or a HD and what is the difference.  10/9/08. Return to previous page  Gain - Gain is a measure of how much signal the antenna will collect. The gain varies according to the direction. If the maker specifies a gain for the antenna, it refers to the gain in the antenna’s best direction. Hi, i have an early 2011 15" baseline macbook pro. Upgraded to 8gb and today i have switched out the optical drive for a second HD (toshiba 320gb 7200). 
I have a tendency to use way too many tracks. I know, keep it simple, i'm working on it. So i've gotten used to doing all the tricks I need to do to have my computer not implode while trying to play through 100 different tracks with lots of CPU heavy plugins. (2.4 ghz, and 8gb ram btw) Once my computer starts giving me the "Disk is too slow, or system overload" error, I start freezing tracks. Also my motion sensor is turned off, so thats not the problem. I normally try to go through the tracks. Purpose of Postfix performance tuning  The hints and tips in this document help you improve the performance of Postfix systems that already.

The projects in hich I experience this behaviour are audio ^(First of, let me tell you that I'm not a pro musician or audio engineer. It has always been my main hobby and I feel like I have decent understanding of most of the workings. As /u/drasil pointed out, the tips might be most suitable for EDM production, however I have mostly produced psychedelic and experimental/weird music - with classic elements and recorded elements too - for the past few years, and it applies there too. These tricks are not alpha-omega to everyone and will not work to every. 
Thermal shock occurs when a thermal gradient causes different parts of an object to expand by different amounts. This differential expansion can be understood in terms of stress or of strain, equivalently. What's your buffer size? Try creating an empty audio track and selecting that before starting playback.

So it seems my computer is having a strange issue of late. I first noticed it when I played a game; FFXIV. At certain points it got seriously choppy, but it was a day or two after patch, so I chalked it up to server overload or even DDOS attacks since that's happened several times before. But then I ran my oculus rift and games that were normally silky smooth were a little choppy at times too. Also I saw when my FFXIV game would be choppy in my other monitor facebook would give an error Haven't tried that yet, don't have the time, some deadlines for thursday. I hope it doesn't bother me too much. I'll try on friday to do some more troubleshooting. gtTime to get the new arc Started (https://i.imgur.com/vKUpUVH.mp4)!
